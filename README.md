# Cakepop
It's small and sweet!

Cakepop is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly search up information without opening a new tab.
Based off of an action, be it a quick snapshot or highlighting of text, the chrome extension will pull
up relevant information and links in a side preview which can be accessed from the side of the page.
